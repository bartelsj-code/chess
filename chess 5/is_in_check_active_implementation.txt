king is at coords 0
piece1 moved from coords1 to coords2
given the species of piece1, could it be attacking coords0 from coords2
    if it could, get a list of squares that lie between coords 0 and coords2
        if any of those squares is occupied we break and continue. if none are, we return True
    next we check whether coords1 is in either an orthagonal or diagonal square from coord0
    if it is:
        get a list of squares that lie beyond coords1 in the line that coords0 and coords1 are on.
        check any square beyond coords1 in that line of attack for an attacker with that attacking capability. break if occupant exists but is not attacker
dict1
key = (coords0, species of piece1) : value = {all possible squares of attack}
