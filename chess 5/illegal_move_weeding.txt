if in check, check if is double check. 
If it is, dispose of all non king moves. 
If not then the final position of a piece move would have to be in the squares in between the king and attacker, or on the attacker. 
if the king moves, it must not be in check in the following position.

if not in check, then we must simply check for pins. Search for own pieces along diagonals and orthagonals. If you find one, keep following that direction until you A: run into a wall, B: find a non threatening piece (either color), C: find a threat. If a threat is found, then make the move of the initial piece illegal.

for all king moves, we need to get the following gamestate and check for threats on king. If found, move is illegal.
